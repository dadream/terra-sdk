# Mini Program Implementation Status

## Baseline

Branch `feature/miniprogram-sdk` uses an independent worktree based on
`e361b81`. The original `main` branch was pushed to `origin/main` before
implementation began.

## M0: Complete

- The implementation roadmap defines scope, contracts, milestones, and gates.
- `desktop_oracle_manifest.txt` freezes viewer/nav3d source trees and direct
  CMake target declarations.
- `check_desktop_oracle.sh` rejects committed, staged, unstaged, or untracked
  changes under those frozen paths.
- `verify_miniprogram_foundation.sh` provides the focused additive gate.

## M1: In Progress

Implemented locally:

- native Mini Program project and full-canvas WebGL probe;
- deterministic shader draw and framebuffer readback;
- checked-in 41-byte Wasm module exporting `add`;
- `WXWebAssembly` loader with expected result 42;
- modern/legacy system capability collection;
- optional credential-free HTTPS ArrayBuffer probe;
- host utility tests and operator documentation.

Still required before M1 can be marked complete:

- successful WeChat DevTools run and screenshot/report;
- successful Android and iOS runs and screenshot/reports;
- configured request-domain ArrayBuffer result;
- reviewed reference-device frame and memory thresholds.

## M2: In Progress

Native characterization coverage now includes:

- checked-in globe and planar metadata matching the desktop cylindrical and
  1k reference datasets;
- a 379-line golden report for planar/cylindrical metadata, coordinate
  transforms, canonical grid points, root topology, first child patch IDs, and
  the viewer-equivalent globe camera action sequence;
- exact camera projection/view/PV matrices, clip planes, camera positions, and
  fixed bounding-volume visibility results for initial, zoom, 45-degree tilt,
  30-degree yaw, and reset states;
- a checked-in real globe detail record plus golden framing, `64x64` residual
  decode statistics, sample values, and raw/decoded hashes;
- global-geodetic WMTS level, row, column, matrix-offset, and URL mapping
  contracts covered by `terra_sdk_geo_tilemap_smoke`;
- dedicated CTests and focused Docker verification script;
- default integration into the complete baseline gate.

Deterministic deeper LOD cuts and native-versus-Wasm parity remain for
subsequent M2/M3 slices.

## Verification Evidence

The implementation worktree passed:

```bash
bash scripts/verify_miniprogram_foundation.sh
bash scripts/verify_miniprogram_native_golden.sh
bash scripts/verify_baseline.sh
bash scripts/verify_globe.sh
```

The complete CMake build contained no `warning:` matches. The 1k baseline,
viewer globe fixed views, and nav3d globe capture passed. In the latest globe
run, viewer capture mean differences ranged from 0.0 to approximately 0.7261
within the 2.0 limit; the nav3d globe difference was 0.0.
